# planning

This is the planning phase of the journey.

Planning is important as it tries to eliminate as much unknowns as possible in the journey to create a nice balance between knowns and unknowns for the whole group.

> "Failing to plan is planning to fail" - Benjamin Franklin

## people

There are several attributes for people who want to partipate in this journey to make it nice for everyone.

- flexible and chill
- good conversationalist
- introspective

One can send out invitation to people they know that might fit the profiles to start the organizing a `walk-talk-meditate` journey.

## size

The ideal size would be between 8 to 10 people. The max would be 12. Smaller size would work too but the conversation might stall after a few days.

There could a buffer to add one more person because someone else might cancel at the last minute.

## duration

The ideal duration would be between 5 to 7 days. The vibe of the group slowly gets built up in the initial days and by the mid point to the end that's when people develop a harmonizing group energy.

Longer and shorter duration might work too depending on the size of the group.

The duration can be very fluid but it is important to set a concrete days and plan it out based on that duration.

*NOTE*: one can always arrive early and leave latter to take in the new environment by themselves or with others.
