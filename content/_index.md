# welcome

`walk-talk-meditate` is an open-source approach to taking pilgrimages in the physical world to harmonize your state of being.

# what

This is another iteration of the `walk-n-talk` movement with an extra component for `meditation`.

By open-sourcing this we hope people will be inspired to take this idea and start their own pilgrimage around the world.

We provide the template to start your own pilgrimage based on the idea of `walk-talk-meditate`. You can organize your own group or join another.

The [template](/template) can always be improved further so please feel free submit any new ideas.

The [routes](/routes) will be updated with various routes that people have taken.

---

`walk` - there is something about walking that stimulates the flow of a conversation in a spontenous way - strengthening the physical body

`talk` - ask and share your own unique perspective of the nature of reality we all share - expanding the conceptual mind

`meditate` - seek the peace and calmness within and harmonize your being with the energy of the group and environment - raising the spiritual body

# why

It's more important than ever to take the time away from the business of our daily lives in a hyper-connected world.

This serves as a guide to help you connect with yourself and other like-minded individuals in an environment conducive to harmonize ourselves within.

> "Environment is stronger than willpower." - Paramhansa Yogananda

By being in a spiritual environment we naturally become attuned to the energy and frequency of that environment.

This is amplified by the group's energy as well when we harmonize ourselves through group meditations.

> "If you wish to understand the Universe think of energy, frequency, and vibration." - Nikola Tesla

We are but a tiny tuning fork vibrating at certain frequency producing energy. The pilgrimage environment raises our energy, frequency and vibration by just our presence alone.

We hope you will take away some lessons and wisdoms from within and without yourself by the end of the pilgrimage and feel the peace and calmness that you have always had within.

# who

Anyone can join this journey.

It is recommended that you start a meditation practice beforehand as each meditation session will be at least 30 minutes long.

We do ask people to follow just one rule: `treat others as you would treat your highest self`

Please be mindful and respectful of each other.

We all have our own unique journey but we all have the same goal.
